There is no entry fee, so visitors can enjoy the 6,000 pieces of history for free. The museum also has educational services like critical thinking of plastic consumption and such. The neocolonial building, built in the 1930s, is a piece of history worth admiring.

        <p class="rhomep">This multi-purpose stadium is known for its cleaniness, and for also replacing the old stadium. Built in 2011, this new stadium can house about 35,000 occupants, which in turns allows fans to watch soccer in all its glory. In fact the first event the stadium hosted was a friendly match between Costa Rica and China, which ended in a tie. However, that's not all as the stadium has hosted a number of concerts as well. The stadium is a perfect place for sport & music lovers to come together and have one in a lifetime experience.
