## Gateway Project

The website is a travel site for San Jose, Costa Rica, where it contains 4 pages. The first page is the home page, 
where there is a short blurb on thhe city. The second page is the Activities page which list out the many acitivites one
can engage in the city, while the IT page offers places to work if one is in the tech field. The last page is the contact page.
This was the first website that I have ever created using just HTML and CSS.

## How To Run It 

First clone the repo, and once you have the code up, you can open it up with a live server in order to see the pages.
