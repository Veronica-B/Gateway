San Jose is located in the beautiful country known as Costa Rica, which is known for its biodiversity and its flourishing lands. It's the capital city of the nation that leads the fight for clean energy, and maintains its spot as one of the most environmentally progressive countries of the world. The citizens are easy-going and friendly, which is reflected in their common saying, "Pura Vida". It means hello, goodbye, no worries, being thankful, etc, and the phrase is a small glimpse of the wonderful culture. San Jose boasts of having delicious coffee which is a must-have especially for caffeine-deprived. With a cup of coffee in hand, it is easier to keep up with the many experiences that the city and her inhabitants have to offer.
